# Steve Grimstead
### Experienced IT Infrastructure Architect and Solutions Specialist with a proven background in designing, deploying, and managing both traditional and cloud-based environments

Hello and welcome! 

Iâ€™m Steve and Iâ€™ve been in IT for over 2 decades. I am passionate about building robust, secure, and scalable digital environments. With years of hands-on experience managing Windows Server infrastructures and core network services, I thrive at the intersection of technology and problem-solving.

Through my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@stevegrimstead) I share the knowledge Iâ€™ve gained from over two decades in the IT industry in a fun and engaging way. My goal is to break down complex topics, making them accessible and easy to understand, so that you can build a solid toolkit and the confidence to tackle whatever IT challenges you might face out in the wild.
